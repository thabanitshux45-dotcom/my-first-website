    <h1>The platelets cells</h1>
    <p>2-4 micrometers long 
Have a ring of microtubules around their periphery, extensively invaginated membrane and intricate canalicular system which communicates with the ECF. Membrane receptors: are for collagen, ADP, vessel wall vWF, fibrinogen.Cytoplasm contents: actin, myosin, glycogen, lysosomes.Have a half life of about 4 days, about 300 000 per microlitre of blood.Filled with granules: dense granules, alpha granules.Alpha granules: contain secreted proteins, eg platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).Dense granules: contain non-protein substances which are secreted in response to 
activation, eg serotonin, ADP, adenine nucleotides.When activated, develop pseudopods which increase their surface area.During activation, ADP and thromboxane A2 are released, activating other platelets.Fibrinogen binds platelets together. After aggregation the platelets undergo apoptosis.Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) causes an increase in platelet count, some platelets 
are stored in the spleen/thrombocytosis </p>
