<h1> The Erythrocytes(Red Blood Cells)</h1>

<p> It is the most abundant blood cell, 10 trillion red blood cells are produced daily on 
average.The spleen removes abnormal RBCs.Red blood cells must be able to move through the microvasculature, maintain 
hemoglobin in its reduced form, maintain osmotic equilibrium, travel 480km in the blood 
vessels within its 120day lifespan.They can change shape to fit into very small capillaries.Red cells are able to carry out their functions due to their flexible biconcave shape, 
ability to generate energy as ATP, ability to generate NADH and NADPH.Any anomalies associated with these abilities will result in a diseased state. Most 
diseases related to red cells are associated with anemia.In children, blood cells are produced in the cavity of all bones 
Bone marrow is one of the largest organs in the body. Normally, 75% of the cells in 
marrow are for the myeloid series which produces WBCs and 25% is for the RBCs (more 
WBCs produced more cause they have short lives compared to RBCs)

<h2>Normal Erythropoiesis</h2>
<br>
Erythrocytes develop from the hematopoietic stem cell through:Pronormoblast, basophilic normoblast,polychromatic normoblast,orthochromatic 
normoblast,reticulocyte,mature red cell.Primitive erythroblasts are produced in the first two weeks of life in the embryonic sac.Definitive erythroblasts, granulocytes, megakaryocytes  are produced after 2.5 months 
of life.Lymphocytes are produced after the 4th month.Moncytes are produced after the 5th month.Liver takes over from yolk sac at 1.5 months.The spleen is involved from 2.5 to 6.5 months.From birth to adulthood, the bone marrow takes over in blood cell production and if the 
bone marrow fails, the liver and spleen will take over.In children, blood cells are produced in the cavities of all bones.When blood cells are being produced by the liver and spleen in an adult human, it can be 
indicative of bone marrow failure.Polychromatic normoblasts produce hemoglobin which is brown, blue and purple in 
colour (many coloursïƒ polychromatic/polychromatophilic).Reticulocytes must be kept in the bone marrow, only 0.5-1% are allowed into the 
circulation, if there are more it can be indicative of haemolysis.Pronormoblasts divide into basophilic normoblasts. Basophilic normoblasts divide to 
form polychromatic normoblasts. Each Pronormoblast can produce 16 mature red cells 
by mitotic divisions.</p>
