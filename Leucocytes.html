    <h1>White Blood Cells</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2>Granulocytes</h2>
<p>These are neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes.Basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils are called polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Average half-life for neutrophils in circulation is 6 hours.Over 100 billion neutrophils are produced per day.Neutrophils can be attracted to site of inflammation/infection by chemokines through chemotaxis.Neutrophils engulf pathogens and release their granules into the phagosomes. Granules can contain antimicrobial agents/defensins. Neutrophils can also cause the oxygen burst 
(series of reactions occurring just outside the cell which releases oxygen radicals onto pathogens). Are the most abundant WBC in blood.
<br>
Eosinophils: 
Have a short half-life in circulation, defend against parasites. Attracted to 
endothelium by selectins, bind to integrins on the vessel wall and move to tissues by 
diapedesis. Especially abundant in mucosa of the GIT, respiratory tract, urinary tract. 
Circulating eosinophils are increased in allergic reactions, GIT disease, asthma, 
respiratory disease 
<br>
Basophils:
Resemble mast cells of CT. contain histamine and inflammatory mediators 
when activated by antigens (usually allergens) which bind to IgE. Mediate allergic 
reactions from mild urticaria and rhinitis to severe anaphylactic shock.
<br> 
<br>
<h2>Lympocytes</h2>
T lymphocytes:
T helper, T cytotoxic, T memory and T suppressor/regulatory. Produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus gland.B lymphocytes: mature into plasma cells and memory B cells which produce antibodies, 
are the only cells which express the genes for antibodiesundergo gene rearrangement with the help of T helper 2 (mainly) cells. Produced in the bone marrow and mature in bursal equivalent (bone marrow in mammals, cause mammals don’t have bursae which 
are used for B lymphocyte maturation-some animals have them).Immunity is divided into: innate and adaptive immunity.

<h3>Agranulocytes</h3>
Eg. Tissue macrophages, Kupffer cells, microglia, monocytes, osteoclasts.Cells have agranular cytoplasm and a kidney shaped nucleus.Monocytes: can differentiate into tissue macrophages which engulf foreign material without being exposed to antibodies, they hunt for foreign bodies and engulf them.Enter the blood and circulate for about 72 hours before going into the tissues, live in the 
tissues for about 3 months.Macrophages in tissues can end up as giant multinucleate cells in chronic inflammationand some tuberculosis diseases.System where they come from used to be called the reticuloendothelial system but is 
now called the tissue macrophage system.Play a key role in innate immunity </p>
